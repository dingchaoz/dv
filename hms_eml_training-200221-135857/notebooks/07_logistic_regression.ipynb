It just creates confusion because they are not equivalent.\n\nThey measure the same thing on different scales. Imagine how confusing it would be if people used degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit interchangeably. “It’s going to be 35 degrees today” could really make you dress the wrong way.\n\nIn measuring the likelihood of any outcome, we need to know two things: how many times something happened and how many times it could have happened, or equivalently, how many times it didn’t. The outcome of interest is called a success, whether it’s a good outcome or not.\n\nThe other outcome is a failure. Each time one of the outcomes could occur is called a trial. Since each trial must end in success or failure, number of successes and number of failures adds up to total number of trials.\n\nProbability is the number of times success occurred compared to the total number of trials.\n\nOdds are the number of times success occurred compared to the number of times failure occurred.\n\nFor example, to predict the likelihood of accidents at a particular intersection, each car that goes through the intersection is considered a trial. Each trial has one of two outcomes: accident or safe passage. If the outcome we’re most interested in modeling is an accident, that is a success (no matter how morbid it sounds).\n\n**Probability(success)** = number of successes/total number of trials\n\n**Odds(success)** = number of successes/number of failures\n\nOdds are often written as:\n\n    `Number of successes:1 failure`\n\n    which is read as the number of successes for every 1 failure. But often the :1 is dropped.\n\nYou will see a lot of researchers get stuck when learning logistic regression because they are not used to thinking of likelihood on an odds scale.\n\n- Equal odds are 1. 1 success for every 1 failure. 1:1\n- Equal probabilities are .5. 1 success for every 2 trials.\n\n\n- Odds can range from 0 to infinity. \n- Odds greater than 1 indicates success is more likely than failure. \n- Odds less than 1 indicates failure is more likely than success.\n\n\n- Probability can range from 0 to 1. \n- Probability greater than .5 indicates success is more likely than failure. \n- Probability less than .5 indicates failure is more likely than success.\n\n\n#### THE EXAMPLE: \n\nIn the last month, data from a particular intersection indicate that of the 1,354 cars that drove through it, 72 got into an accident.\n\n- 72 Successes = Accident\n- 1282 Failures = Safe Passage (1,354 – 72)\n\n\n- Failures = Total – Successes\n\n\n- Pr(Accident) = 72/1354 = .053\n- Pr(Safe Passage) = 1282/1354 = .947\n\n\n- Odds(Accident) = 72/1282 = .056\n- Odds(Safety) = 1282/72 = 17.87\n\n\nNow get out your calculator, because you’ll see how these relate to each other.\n\n- Odds(Accident) = Pr(Accident)/Pr(Safety) = .053/.947"
